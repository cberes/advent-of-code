# advent-of-code

My attempts at [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016). I'm planning on using Clojure for every task.

## Usage

Run using `lein`

    lein run DAY INPUT_FILE

The first argument is the day, and the second is the path to the input file. For example

    lein run 1 /path/to/day-1-input

## Update (2016-12-26)

I hacked my way through day 24.

## Update (2016-12-25)

Well, I worked hard to catch up. I skipped day 22 (part 2) and day 24 (maybe I will revisit this one). But until I finish those two outstanding tasks, it looks like that's all she wrote.

## Update (2016-12-13)

The first ten days were fun, but the last two days have taken too much of my time. So, I cannot complete these challenges on a daily basis.
