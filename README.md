# advent-of-code

My attempts at [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/2016). I'm planning on using Clojure for every task.

## Usage

Run using `lein`

    lein run DAY INPUT_FILE

The first argument is the day, and the second is the path to the input file. For example

    lein run 1 /path/to/day-1-input
